## 🐚 Bash & Linux Notes

Welcome! This repository is a collection of Bash and Linux commands I've recently learned and found useful. I'm documenting them here for quick reference and continuous learning.

### 📁 What You'll Find Here:

* Handy Bash commands and Linux one-liners.
* Tweaks and customizations from my `.bashrc` and `.bash_profile`.
* A `cron`-based automation setup that auto-updates Homebrew at the start of every month.
* Personal notes and summaries based on tutorials and hands-on experience.

### 🎓 Learning Source

I followed [this great tutorial by CodeSchafey](https://youtu.be/j6vKLJxAKfw?si=2mph6H5cRNF72hr5) to get started with Bash scripting. This repo includes my takeaways and personalized notes from that video.

This is a living document — I’ll keep updating it as I discover new tricks and tools.
